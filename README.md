## How It Works

### The Water Treatment Process
```
Raw Water → PUMP → FILTER → UV LIGHT → Clean Water
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Raw Water Enters** - Water comes into the system, sensors check tank levels
2. **Pump Starts** - Computer-controlled pump moves the water, pressure monitored
3. **Filtration** - Water passes through filters (6-second delay after pump start)
4. **UV Sterilization** - Ultraviolet light kills bacteria (6-second delay after filter)
5. **Clean Water Output** - Treated water ready for use, all parameters monitored

## System Components

### Physical Equipment
- **Main Pump** - Moves water through the system
- **Filter System** - Removes dirt and particles
- **UV Reactor** - Kills bacteria with ultraviolet light
- **Sensors** - Measure pressure, flow, water clarity, and levels

### Control System
- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)** - Main computer controlling everything
- **Web Interface** - Website for monitoring and control
- **Dashboard** - Visual display showing system status and alarms

## Monitored Parameters

| Parameter | Normal Range | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Pressure** | 20-80 bar | Monitor pump performance |
| **Flow Rate** | Above 10 L/min | Detect blockages |
| **Turbidity** | Below 15 NTU | Water clarity check |
| **Water Level** | Above 20% | Prevent pump damage |

### Status Indicators
- **Green Light** - System running normally
- **Orange Light** - Filter active
- **Red Light** - UV sterilizer active
- **Fault Light** - Problem detected

## Safety Features

### Automatic Protection
- **Emergency Stop** - Instant shutdown capability
- **Safety Interlocks** - Prevent unsafe operations
- **Timed Sequences** - Equipment starts in proper order
- **Fault Detection** - Automatic shutdown on problems

### Alarm Types
- **Critical** - Immediate shutdown required
- **Warning** - Problem detected but system continues
- **Normal** - Everything working correctly

## System Operation

### Starting the System
1. Check no alarms are active
2. Verify water level and no emergency stops
3. Press start button
4. Monitor automatic startup sequence
